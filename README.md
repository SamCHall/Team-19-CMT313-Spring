# Team 19 CMT313 Spring

This is the repository for our Automated Assessment Tool. The code for this has
been written using **Flask** to create a website.

## Installing

To run the code, first create a virtual environment and install all the packages
from `requirements.txt` using pip. Next, activate your virtual environment. You 
may next want to create a .env file to specify any environment variables. Thirdly,
enable your virtual environment. Finally, use Python to run wsgi.py.

An example using pipenv:
```
$ pipenv install -r requirements.txt
$ pipenv shell
$ python wsgi.py
```
