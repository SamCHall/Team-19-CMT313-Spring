SCSS accepts eveything that CSS does and more. Feel free to write standard CSS in an SCSS file.

To create a new (s)css file:
- In the scss folder create a new file with the following naming convention (note that all files
  types must be .scss, even if it contains standard CSS):
    '_example.scss'
- Import the file to main.scss using a variation on the following:
    @import 'example';

All of the files imported to main.scss are automatically included in a single .css file and are
passed to base.html. There is no need to import them to base.html manually.
